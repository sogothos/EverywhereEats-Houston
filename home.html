        <h3>Why</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Agribusiness practices, such as monocropping and the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, cause significant damage to the environment. Additionally, the system fails to include culturally important foods, leaving consumers without staple ingredients in their culture. Click the button below to learn more about why a cooperative like Everywhere Eats is so beneficial for the people and the land.</p>
